# Implementation Complete - All Issues Fixed ✅

## Summary

All 6 major issues have been successfully fixed and implemented:

### ✅ Issue 1: Button Layout - Single Row
**Status:** Complete

- Consolidated all revision buttons into a single horizontal row
- Removed the "Show Answer" button (answers now always visible)
- Removed separate answer-controls div
- New layout: `[Back] [Skip] [Next] [Wrong] [Correct]`

**Files Modified:**
- `index.html` (lines 154-160)

---

### ✅ Issue 2: Wrong Button Logic
**Status:** Complete

- Fixed the "Wrong" button to reinsert questions after exactly 5 other questions
- Removed the wrongAnswers queue system
- Questions now appear after 5 questions instead of waiting for 5 wrong answers

**Implementation:**
```javascript
function markWrong() {
    const question = state.revisionQuestions.shift();
    const insertPosition = Math.min(5, state.revisionQuestions.length);
    state.revisionQuestions.splice(insertPosition, 0, question);
    updateProgress();
    displayCurrentQuestion();
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `main.js` (markWrong function, state initialization, updateProgress, resetRevision)

---

### ✅ Issue 3: Auto-Show Answers
**Status:** Complete

- Answers are now always visible in revision mode
- No need to click "Show Answer" button
- Cleaner, faster user experience

**Files Modified:**
- `main.js` (displayCurrentQuestion function)

---

### ✅ Issue 4: Programming Section Tag System
**Status:** Complete

**Added to `data/programming.json`:**
- Each question now has a `type` field (html, css, javascript, python, c, shell)
- Each question now has a `tags` array (e.g., ["html"], ["js"], ["css"], ["git"], ["c"], ["python"])
- Added 2 more sample questions (Git and C) for diversity

**Tag Filter UI:**
- Clickable tag chips (#html, #js, #css, #c, #git, #python, #react)
- Search input for typing tags (e.g., "#html")
- "All" button to clear filters
- Active tag highlighting
- Real-time filtering of questions

**Files Modified:**
- `data/programming.json` (added type and tags fields)
- `main.js` (addTagFilterUI, filterByTag, searchTags functions)
- `style.css` (tag filter styling)

---

### ✅ Issue 5: Code Persistence Per Question
**Status:** Complete

**Implementation:**
- Each question's code is saved to `localStorage` with unique key: `code_{section}_{questionIndex}`
- Code persists across page refreshes
- When reopening a question, saved code is loaded instead of default answer
- Code is automatically saved when closing the editor

**Storage Format:**
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('code_programming_3', userEditedCode);
```

**Files Modified:**
- `main.js` (updated code button to load saved code)
- `code_editor.js` (closeEditor saves to localStorage, openEditor accepts context)

---

### ✅ Issue 6: Code Editor Panel Loading & Fixes
**Status:** Complete

**Fixed:**
1. **Correct Panel Loading:**
   - HTML code loads in HTML panel
   - CSS code loads in CSS panel
   - JavaScript code loads in JavaScript panel
   - Python/C/Shell code loads in JS panel with helpful comment

2. **Enter Key for New Lines:**
   - Enter key creates new lines (natural textarea behavior)
   - Ctrl+Enter runs code
   - No blocking of Enter key

3. **Undo/Redo:**
   - Browser native Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y works (no custom buttons needed)

4. **Compiler Working:**
   - Verified runCode() function properly compiles HTML, CSS, JS
   - Live preview updates correctly

**New Function Signature:**
```javascript
openEditor(initialCode, codeType, sectionId, questionIndex)
```

**Files Modified:**
- `code_editor.js` (openEditor, closeEditor functions)
- `main.js` (code button onclick handlers, openRevisionCodeEditor helper)

---

### ✅ Issue 7 (Bonus): Section Click Handlers Fixed
**Status:** Complete

- Programming and Languages sections now open correctly
- Fixed code button generation to work properly
- Added proper onclick handlers with code persistence

**Files Modified:**
- `main.js` (displayQuestions function)

---
