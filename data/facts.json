    "answer": "Vatican City (0.44 square kilometers)"
  },
  {
    "question": "How hot is lightning compared to the sun?",
    "answer": "Lightning is hotter than the sun! A lightning bolt can reach 30,000°C (54,000°F) — five times hotter than the surface of the Sun."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can dogs smell time?",
    "answer": "Yes! Dogs can smell time. They can sense how long ago something happened by detecting how scent particles fade in the air."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are bananas radioactive?",
    "answer": "Yes, bananas are radioactive! They contain potassium-40, a naturally radioactive isotope — but you'd need to eat 10 million bananas at once to get sick."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a place on Earth where sound can kill you?",
    "answer": "Yes! There's a 'quiet place' on Earth where sound can kill you. The world's quietest room (an anechoic chamber at Microsoft) absorbs 99.99% of sound — people start hallucinating after a few minutes inside."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is quantum tunneling?",
    "answer": "Quantum tunneling lets particles pass through barriers. Normally, a particle doesn't have enough energy to cross a barrier (like a wall). But in quantum mechanics, there's a tiny probability that the particle can \"tunnel\" through it anyway. This happens because particles aren't just points—they behave like waves, spreading out in space. If the wave extends past the barrier, there's a chance the particle will appear on the other side. This effect powers things like nuclear fusion in the Sun and modern tunnel diodes."

  {
    "question": "How much would a teaspoon of neutron star material weigh?",
    "answer": "A teaspoon of neutron star material would weigh about 6 billion tons. Neutron stars are the densest visible objects in the universe. Their gravity compresses matter so much that a sugar-cube-sized amount would outweigh all the buildings on Earth combined."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are superconductors?",
    "answer": "There's a state of matter where electrons flow without resistance: superconductors. At very low temperatures, certain materials allow electrons to move freely without losing energy as heat. This makes magnetic levitation trains possible and could revolutionize power transmission."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is spaghettification?",
    "answer": "Spaghettification is real near black holes. If you fell into a black hole, the difference in gravity between your head and feet would stretch you into a thin, long \"spaghetti\" shape before you're crushed. Scientists call this effect tidal stretching."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does your brain produce light?",
    "answer": "Your brain produces measurable light, but you can't see it. Neurons emit biophotons—tiny bursts of light as they fire. This light is extremely weak, far below what the eye can detect, but it may play a role in communication between cells."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the longest movie in the world and how long is it?",
    "answer": "The longest movie ever made is 'Logistics' (2012) by Swedish artists Erika Magnusson and Daniel Andersson. It runs for **51,420 minutes** (857 hours or about **35.6 days**). The film shows the journey of a pedometer from its factory in China to a store in Sweden, filmed in real-time. It's more of an art installation than a traditional movie."
  },
  {
    "question": "What shape is wombat poop and why?",
    "answer": "Wombat poop is cube-shaped so it doesn't roll away. The unique cube shape helps wombats mark their territory more effectively by preventing the droppings from rolling down hills or slopes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do humans emit light?",
    "answer": "Yes! You're glowing right now. Humans emit a faint bioluminescent light — it's just too weak to see with the naked eye. This bioluminescence is produced by chemical reactions in our cells."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there more trees on Earth or stars in the Milky Way?",
    "answer": "There are more trees on Earth than stars in the Milky Way. Roughly 3 trillion trees vs about 200–400 billion stars in our galaxy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can hot water freeze faster than cold water?",
    "answer": "Yes! Hot water can freeze faster than cold water. It's called the Mpemba Effect, named after a Tanzanian student who observed this phenomenon. Scientists are still studying why this happens."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is a day on Venus longer than a year on Venus?",
    "answer": "Yes! A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus. It rotates slower than it orbits the sun — one Venus day takes 243 Earth days, while one Venus year takes only 225 Earth days."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do sharks detect their prey?",
    "answer": "Sharks can detect electrical fields using special sensors called ampullae of Lorenzini to sense prey, even when hidden in sand or murky water."
  },
  {
    "question": "How often does your stomach get a new lining?",
    "answer": "Your stomach gets a new lining every 3-4 days to prevent it from digesting itself due to the strong acids it produces."
  },
  {
    "question": "What particle can pass through mountains?",
    "answer": "There's a particle called the muon that can pass through mountains. Muons are created by cosmic rays and can penetrate hundreds of meters of rock before decaying."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can plants hear pollinators?",
    "answer": "Plants can 'hear' pollinators! Some flowers vibrate their nectar-producing organs in response to the wingbeats of bees to attract them."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the shadow biosphere hypothesis?",
    "answer": "Scientists speculate there might be life on Earth with a completely different biochemistry that we haven't detected yet - this is called the 'shadow biosphere' hypothesis."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can metals flow over time?",
    "answer": "Some metals can 'flow' over time! Lead and some other soft metals slowly deform under their own weight at room temperature over decades."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there rain that falls upward?",
    "answer": "There's a type of rain that falls upward! On Mars, under certain conditions, dust and ice particles can be lofted upward by winds, creating 'reverse precipitation.'"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does ice float on water?",
    "answer": "Water has a strange property near freezing called 'density anomaly.' Ice floats because water expands as it freezes, unlike almost every other liquid."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can rocks sing?",
    "answer": "There's a rock that can 'sing!' Some quartz-rich stones produce sounds when rubbed or struck due to piezoelectric effects."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there glass forests on Earth?",
    "answer": "There are 'glass forests' on Earth! Volcanic activity can create natural formations called Pele's hair and Pele's tears - fibrous volcanic glass that looks like a forest of glass strands."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can bacteria survive inside radioactive waste?",
    "answer": "Some bacteria can survive inside radioactive waste! Deinococcus radiodurans can repair its DNA even after massive radiation exposure."
  },
  {
    "question": "How often are your bones replaced?",
    "answer": "Your bones are constantly 'remodeled!' Every 10 years or so, almost your entire skeleton has been replaced at the cellular level without you noticing."
