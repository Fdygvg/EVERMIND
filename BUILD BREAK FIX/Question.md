What does flex: 5 and flex: 1 mean in CSS, and how do they affect how elements share space inside a flex container? ü§î

üí° Answer:

flex tells the browser how much space each flex item should take compared to the others.
When you write a number like flex: 5, it means:

‚ÄúGive this element 5 parts of the available space.‚Äù

And flex: 1 means:

‚ÄúGive this element 1 part of the available space.‚Äù

So if two elements have flex: 5 and flex: 1, the total space is divided into 6 parts.
üßÆ The first gets 5 parts, the second gets 1 part.

üß© Example Code:
<div class="task-container">
  <input type="text" placeholder="Enter task..." />
  <button>Add</button>
</div>

.task-container {
  display: flex;
  background: #fff;
  padding: 10px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
}

.task-container input {
  flex: 5; /* üß† Takes 5 parts of space */
  padding: 8px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}

.task-container button {
  flex: 1; /* üí™ Takes 1 part of space */
  padding: 8px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  background: #4CAF50;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}

üé® Result Visually:

üß± [Input Field ‚Äî takes 5/6 width]
üü© [Button ‚Äî takes 1/6 width]

üß† Analogy:

Think of a pizza üçï sliced into 6 equal pieces:

The input says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry! I‚Äôll take 5 slices.‚Äù

The button says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just take 1 slice.‚Äù

That‚Äôs flex: 5 vs flex: 1 ‚Äî it‚Äôs all about sharing space fairly between flex items! üí™‚ú®
---------------------------------
how do you make list items display plain
list-style is a CSS property that controls how list markers (bullets or numbers) appear on <ul> or <ol> elements.

The value none removes the default bullets or numbers from the list items.

Example:

<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>

ul {
  list-style: none; /* removes bullets */
  padding: 0;       /* optional: removes default indentation */
  margin: 0;
}


Result:

Item 1
Item 2


No bullets or numbers appear next to the list items.

list-style is a property, and none is its value.
------------------------
What is OOP and its 4 Pillars

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a way of writing code where you organize your program using objects. Each object can have data (properties) and actions (methods), making your code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain.

The 4 pillars of OOP are:

Encapsulation ‚Äì Hiding internal details and exposing only what‚Äôs needed.
keeping the data inside an object safe and only letting other parts of the code interact with it through controlled methods.

Abstraction ‚Äì Showing only essential features while hiding complexity.
hiding the complex details of how something works and showing only what‚Äôs necessary to the user.

The idea is: the user doesn‚Äôt need to know all the internal steps, just the functionality.

You provide a simple interface while keeping the inner workings hidden.


Inheritance ‚Äì Creating new classes based on existing ones to reuse code.
Inheritance = creating a new class based on an existing class, so the new class inherits properties and methods from the original.

It helps reuse code instead of writing the same stuff again.

The new class can also add or override methods.


Polymorphism ‚Äì Allowing the same method name to behave differently in different classes.
Polymorphism = ‚Äúmany forms‚Äù.
In programming, it means the same method name can behave differently depending on the object.

This usually happens when a child class overrides a method from a parent class.
-----------------
what is the .call function
call()

call() is a method in JavaScript that lets you call a function and set what this means inside it.

Normally, this points to the object that calls the function.

call() lets you force this to be another object.

Example:
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, I am " + this.name);
}

const person = { name: "Chuks" };

sayHello();           // Hello, I am undefined (no object)
sayHello.call(person); // Hello, I am Chuks


Here, call(person) sets this inside sayHello() to the person object.
-----------------------------------
what is the .prototype 
What is .prototype?

Every function in JavaScript has a prototype object.

When you use a function as a constructor (with new), the objects created inherit from that prototype.

It‚Äôs used to share methods between all objects created by that constructor.

Example 1: Basic Prototype
function Vehicle(brand) {
  this.brand = brand;
}

// Add method to prototype
Vehicle.prototype.drive = function() {
  console.log(this.brand + " is driving");
};

const car1 = new Vehicle("Toyota");
const car2 = new Vehicle("Honda");

car1.drive(); // Toyota is driving
car2.drive(); // Honda is driving


drive() is not stored inside car1 or car2, it‚Äôs in Vehicle.prototype.

All vehicles share the same drive function, saving memory.

Example 2: Adding another method later
Vehicle.prototype.honk = function() {
  console.log(this.brand + " says beep!");
};

car1.honk(); // Toyota says beep!
car2.honk(); // Honda says beep!


You can add methods to the prototype anytime, and all existing objects get access.

Summary in One Line

.prototype = a place to put methods that all objects created from a constructor can share.

How to ‚Äúoverride‚Äù or remove it for a specific child

You can shadow the property by setting it to undefined or another value on the child.

car.wheels = undefined; // now car has its own 'wheels', hiding the prototype one
console.log(car.wheels); // undefined
console.log(Vehicle.prototype.wheels); // 4 ‚Üí parent unaffected


The parent (Vehicle.prototype) is never changed.
---------------
what is the extends class 
extends

extends is used in JavaScript classes to say:
‚ÄúThis class is a child of another class.‚Äù
It means the child will inherit everything (variables + functions) from the parent.
--------------------------
what  is the .foreach function
.forEach() is just a loop for arrays.
It means ‚Äúfor every item in this array, do something.‚Äù

Example:

const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

fruits.forEach(function(fruit) {
  console.log(fruit);
});


Output:

apple
banana
orange


It‚Äôs just a cleaner version of:

for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
  console.log(fruits[i]);
}
----------------------
what are getters and setters in js 
They‚Äôre special methods used to control access to object properties.

Getters

Used to get a property value safely.

const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  get fullName() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

console.log(person.fullName); // John Doe

Setters

Used to set (change) a property safely.

const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
 set name(newName) {
    if (newName.length < 3) {
      console.log("Name too short!");
    } else {
      this._name = newName;
    }
  }
}

‚úÖ Summary

get ‚Üí reads a value

set ‚Üí updates a value

nb: that underscore (_) isn‚Äôt a special operator or syntax in JavaScript.
It‚Äôs just a naming convention ‚Äî something developers use by habit to signal:

‚ÄúThis property is private ‚Äî don‚Äôt touch it directly.‚Äù
---------------------------
What is Object Literal Syntax?

Object literal syntax is the easiest way to create an object in JavaScript without using a class or constructor.

You just write the object directly using curly braces {}.

You define properties (data) and methods (functions) inside it.
const car = {
  brand: "Toyota",      // property
  color: "red",         // property
  drive: function() {   // method
    console.log(this.brand + " is driving");
  }
};

console.log(car.brand); // Toyota
car.drive();            // Toyota is driving
car is an object.

Properties: brand, color

Method: drive()
--------------------------
what is a constructor function and how do you use it 
constructor  function is a function that is used to create new objects basedon the parameters given 
example code 
 class Person
 constructor (name, age){
  this.age=age
  this.car =car
 }
ps. you can use the this to call any parameter anywhere in the code , and you need the "new" variable, to create a new variable 
it is recommended to creare functions to easily access variables inside a function 

console.log(person1.name)  xxx

getName = () => {
  return this.name;
};

let Person1 = new Person ("Pedro", 19);
console.log(Person1.getName()) //thsi is correct
-------------------------------
can you constructor in another constructor 
yes you can 
class Person {
constructor(name, age){
this.age=age;
this.name=name
}
}
--------------------
what is the super constructor
What it is:

super is a special keyword used in a child class to call the constructor or methods of the parent class (superclass).

When you use it:

Only needed when a class extends another class.

In the constructor of a child class, you must call super() before using this.

What it does:

Runs the parent class constructor, setting up all parent properties.

Allows the child class to inherit parent behavior safely.

How it works:

Think of the parent class as the ‚Äúbase‚Äù of the object.

super() builds the base first.

After that, the child class can add its own properties or methods.

Example:

class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name);        // call parent constructor first
    this.breed = breed; // then add child properties
  }
}

const d = new Dog("Max", "Golden Retriever");
console.log(d.name);  // Max
console.log(d.breed); // Golden Retriever


Rule of thumb:

Child class with extends ‚Üí always call super() first

Then safely use this to add child-specific properties.

how to use font awesome icons for buttons

1Ô∏è‚É£ Include Font Awesome in your project

You need the Font Awesome library in your HTML. The easiest way is via a <link> in your <head>:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css">


This gives you access to all Font Awesome icons.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Add icons to a button

Font Awesome uses <i> or <span> with specific classes.

<button>
  <i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i>
</button>


fa-solid ‚Üí the style of the icon (solid, regular, light, etc.)

fa-plus ‚Üí the icon itself (here, a plus sign)
nb incase youre seeing extra icons , The <i> tag is opened but never closed.

Browsers try to ‚Äúfix‚Äù broken HTML automatically, and this often creates extra empty buttons or icons in the rendered page.

How to fix it

Always close the <i> tag:
--------------------------
how do you make a list of horizontally allignht items vertical in rows with css grid
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    grid-template-columns

Defines how many columns your grid will have, and how wide each column is.

repeat(4, ‚Ä¶)

Shortcut to avoid writing the same thing 4 times.

Instead of:

grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;


You write:

grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);


Means: repeat 1fr 4 times ‚Üí 4 equal columns.

1fr

‚ÄúFractional unit‚Äù ‚Üí the column takes up one fraction of the available space.

If all 4 columns are 1fr, they each take 25% of the width.
---------------------
what is root in css
:root is a CSS pseudo-class selector that targets the highest-level element in the document ‚Äî in HTML, that‚Äôs the <html> element.

So:

:root { ... }


is basically the same as:

html { ... }


‚Ä¶but :root has higher specificity, which makes it better for defining global variables.
-------------------------
is it possible to overwrite e.target ?
assigning e.target = "" does nothing useful ‚Äî you can‚Äôt overwrite the event target.
--------------------------------
what is the closest and trim method
closest()

What it does:

Searches up the DOM tree from the current element until it finds a matching selector.

Returns the first ancestor that matches, including the element itself.

If no match is found, it returns null.

Why we use it here:

Your buttons have <i> icons inside them.

If someone clicks the <i>, e.target is the <i>, not the <button>.

closest("button") ensures we always get the parent button that was clicked, no matter where inside it the user clicks.

Example:

<button id="1">
  <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i>
</button>

document.querySelector("i").addEventListener("click", e => {
  const btn = e.target.closest("button");
  console.log(btn.id); // will print "1"
});


Without closest(), clicking the <i> would give you the <i> element, and .textContent wouldn‚Äôt behave as expected.

2Ô∏è‚É£ trim()

What it does:

Removes whitespace from the start and end of a string.

Keeps the content in the middle untouched.

Why we use it here:

Sometimes button.textContent can include extra spaces or line breaks.

trim() cleans it up so " 1 " becomes "1".

Example:

const text = "   +   ";
console.log(text.trim()); // prints "+"


‚úÖ In your code:

const value = button.textContent.trim();


button.textContent ‚Üí gets everything inside the button (1, +, etc.)

.trim() ‚Üí removes any accidental spaces

Now value is clean and ready to push to your calc array.
-------------------------------------
what is the isNAN 
isNaN is a JavaScript function that checks whether a value is ‚ÄúNot-a-Number‚Äù. It tells you if something cannot be interpreted as a numeric value.

Basic usage:
isNaN(123);      // false ‚Üí 123 is a number
isNaN("123");    // false ‚Üí "123" can be converted to a number
isNaN("abc");    // true  ‚Üí "abc" cannot be converted to a number
isNaN(NaN);      // true  ‚Üí NaN is, by definition, not a number
-----------------------------
how do you update input in js
you use value in js not textcontent or innerText.
------------------------
what is the .join function
The .join() function in JavaScript is used with arrays. It takes all the elements of an array and joins them into a single string, with an optional separator you specify.

Syntax:
array.join(separator)


separator (optional) ‚Üí what you put between the elements in the resulting string.

If you don‚Äôt provide a separator, it defaults to a comma ,.

Examples:
let arr = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

arr.join();         // "apple,banana,cherry"  ‚Üí default is comma
arr.join(" ");      // "apple banana cherry"  ‚Üí space as separator
arr.join(" - ");    // "apple - banana - cherry" ‚Üí custom separator


It works for arrays of numbers too:

let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
nums.join("");      // "1234" ‚Üí no separator
nums.join("-");     // "1-2-3-4"
---------------------------------
what is the eval function
In JavaScript, the eval() function is a built-in function that takes a string as input and executes it as JavaScript code. Essentially, it evaluates a string as if it were actual code in your program.

Syntax
eval(string)


string: A string containing JavaScript code to be executed.

Examples
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let result = eval("x + y");  // evaluates the string as code
console.log(result);          // 30

let code = "console.log('Hello from eval!')";
eval(code);  // prints: Hello from eval!

let a = 5;
eval("a = a * 2");
console.log(a);  // 10
----------------------------
what is try catch
try...catch is used to handle errors gracefully instead of letting your program crash. It lets you ‚Äútry‚Äù a block of code and ‚Äúcatch‚Äù any exceptions (errors) that occur.

Syntax
try {
    // Code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
    // Code to handle the error
} finally {
    // Optional: code that always runs, whether an error occurred or not
}


try: The block of code you want to test for errors.

catch: Executes if an error occurs in the try block. The error object (commonly named error or e) contains information about what went wrong.

finally (optional): Always runs after try and catch, even if there was no error.

Example 1: Basic Error Handling
try {
    let result = riskyFunction();  // might throw an error
    console.log(result);
} catch (error) {
    console.log("An error occurred: " + error.message);
}

Example 2: With finally
try {
    let data = JSON.parse('invalid json');  // will throw a SyntaxError
} catch (e) {
    console.log("Caught an error:", e.message);
} finally {
    console.log("This always runs, cleanup or logging code here.");
}


Output:

Caught an error: Unexpected token i in JSON at position 0
This always runs, cleanup or logging code here.
