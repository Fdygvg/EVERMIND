QUESTION: how do you create a nested and access object
ANSWER:üê∂ 1. The ourDogOwner example
javascript
var ourDogOwner = [
{
name: "Camper",
legs: 4,
eyes: 2,
tail: 1,
friends: ["john", "mark", "mary"],
straight: true,
},
{
name: "John",
age: "22",
status: "Single",
Religion: "Christian",
}
];
üëá What‚Äôs happening here
You made an array [ ... ] that holds two objects inside it (the { ... } parts).

You can think of this like a list of two people:

The first person is a dog named Camper with his details.

The second person is an owner named John with his details.

üß© How you can access the info
ourDogOwner[0] ‚Üí means the first object (the dog Camper).

ourDogOwner[1] ‚Üí means the second object (the owner John).

To get the dog's name:

javascript
console.log(ourDogOwner[0].name); // Camper
To get the owner‚Äôs religion:

javascript
console.log(ourDogOwner[1].Religion); // Christian
To get the dog‚Äôs best friend:

javascript
console.log(ourDogOwner[0].friends[0]); // john
üöó 2. The myStorage example
javascript
var myStorage = {
car: {
passengerSeat: {
money: "$100"
}
}
};
üëá What‚Äôs happening here
This is a nested object ‚Äî an object inside another object.

You can imagine it like a box inside a box:

The first box is myStorage (a garage).

Inside that is another box called car.

Inside car is another box called passengerSeat.

Inside passengerSeat is the money label that says "$100".

üß© How to get that money
To reach the money, you go step by step through each box:

javascript
console.log(myStorage.car.passengerSeat.money); // $100
You can also use bracket notation:

javascript
console.log(myStorage["car"]["passengerSeat"]["money"]); // $100

records[id][prop] = value;
} else if (prop === "tracks" && !records[id][prop]) {
records[id][prop] = [value];
} else if (prop === "tracks" && value !== "") {
records[id][prop].push(value);
} else if (value === "") {
delete records[id][prop];
}
return records;
}

console.log(
updateRecords(recordCollection, 2468, "tracks", "Never Gonna Give You")
);

QUESTION: Give an example of object with keys
ANSWER: Don‚Äôt use [0] unless your data is an array.

Don‚Äôt put quotes after a dot (."artist" ‚ùå).

To get the artist of record 2548:

javascript
recordCollection[2548].artist; // ‚úÖ works!
recordCollection[2548]["artist"]; // ‚úÖ also works!

object.key = value; ‚Üí add a new key

delete object.key; ‚Üí remove a key
