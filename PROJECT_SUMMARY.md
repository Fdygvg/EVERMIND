## 🎯 How Everything Works

### Homepage Flow
```
User opens index.html
    ↓
Sees 7 section cards + Global Revision
    ↓
Can click section → Browse questions
    OR
Select sections → Start Global Revision
```

### Section View Flow
```
User clicks section card
    ↓
Loads all questions from JSON
    ↓
Click question → Reveal answer
    OR
Click "Start Revision Mode"
```

### Revision Mode Flow
```
Questions shuffled randomly
    ↓
Show question (with image if present)
    ↓
User clicks "Show Answer"
    ↓
Answer revealed (with audio/code if present)
    ↓
User marks Correct or Wrong
    ↓
Correct: Question removed
Wrong: Goes back after 5 questions
    ↓
Repeat until all done
    ↓
Celebration message → Auto-exit
```

## 🎨 Theme System

### How Themes Work
1. User clicks theme button (☀️ 🌙 🔴 🔵)
2. `setTheme(name)` function called
3. Sets `data-theme` attribute on `<body>`
4. CSS applies theme-specific colors
5. Preference saved to localStorage
6. Loads automatically on next visit

### Available Themes
- **Light** ☀️ - Clean white with blue accents
- **Dark** 🌙 - Dark gray with soft shadows
- **Red** 🔴 - Warm peach/red gradient
- **Blue** 🔵 - Cool purple/blue gradient

---

## 💾 Data Structure

### JSON Format
```json
[
  {
    "question": "Required: The question text",
    "answer": "Required: The answer text",
    "image": "Optional: path/to/image.png",
    "audio": "Optional: path/to/audio.mp3"
  }
]
```

### Loading System
1. All sections loaded on page load
2. Stored in `state.allQuestions` object
3. Accessed instantly when needed
4. No loading delays during use

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
state = {
  currentSection: null,
  allQuestions: {},           // All loaded questions
  revisionQuestions: [],      // Current revision queue
  currentQuestionIndex: 0,
  wrongAnswers: [],           // Wrong answer buffer
  isAnswerShown: false,
  revisionMode: 'section'     // or 'global'
}
```

### Spaced Repetition Algorithm
```
Wrong answer → Added to wrongAnswers[] buffer
    ↓
When buffer reaches 5 items
    ↓
Oldest item moved back to revisionQuestions[]
    ↓
User sees it again later
```

### Shuffle Algorithm
Fisher-Yates shuffle for true randomization:
```javascript
function shuffleArray(array) {
  for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
  }
}
```
