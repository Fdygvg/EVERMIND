# 🔧 Issues Fixed - Updated Implementation

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Button Layout - Single Row Fixed**
**Problem:** Buttons were wrapping to 2 rows instead of staying in one horizontal line.

**Solution:**
- Changed CSS `flex-wrap: wrap` to `flex-wrap: nowrap`
- Added responsive design with `flex: 1` for equal button sizing
- Added media queries for different screen sizes:
  - Desktop: Full size buttons
  - Tablet (768px): Smaller buttons, reduced gap
  - Mobile (480px): Even smaller buttons, minimal gap
  - Small mobile (360px): Tiny buttons, minimal gap

**Result:** All 5 buttons now stay in one row on all screen sizes.

### 2. **Reveal/Hide Answer Functionality Restored**
**Problem:** Answer was always visible, no toggle functionality.

**Solution:**
- Restored "Show Answer" button in HTML
- Fixed JavaScript to hide answer initially
- Added proper show/hide logic:
  - Initially: Question visible, answer hidden, "Show Answer" button visible
  - After clicking "Show Answer": Answer appears, "Wrong/Correct" buttons appear
  - Button layout: `[Back] [Skip] [Show Answer] [Next]` → `[Wrong] [Correct]`

**Result:** Proper question → reveal answer → mark wrong/correct flow.

### 3. **Compiler Fixed**
**Problem:** Code wasn't executing in preview panel.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `runCode()` function with better error handling
- Added debug logging to track execution
- Fixed iframe content generation with proper HTML structure
- Added `testCode()` function with sample code to verify compiler works
- Added small delay to ensure iframe is ready before execution

**Test Button:** Click "🧪 Test" in code editor to load sample code and verify compiler works.

## 🧪 Testing the Fixes

### Test Button Layout:
1. Open any section → Start Revision
2. **Desktop:** All 5 buttons in one row
3. **Mobile:** Resize browser window, buttons shrink but stay in one row
4. **No wrapping:** Buttons never go to second row

### Test Reveal/Hide Answer:
1. Start revision → See question only
2. Click "Show Answer" → Answer appears, Wrong/Correct buttons show
3. Mark wrong/correct → Next question loads with answer hidden again

### Test Compiler:
1. Open Programming section
2. Click any "💻 Try Code" button
3. Click "🧪 Test" button → Sample code loads
4. Click "▶️ Run" → Preview shows "Hello World!" with blue heading, green text
5. Check browser console → Should see "JavaScript is working!" message
